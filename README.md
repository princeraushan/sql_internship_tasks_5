# SQL Developer Internship – Task 5  
## Aggregate Functions & GROUP BY

## 📌 Task Overview
Task 5 focuses on analyzing and summarizing data using SQL aggregate functions.  
The objective is to understand how large datasets can be grouped and analyzed to extract meaningful insights.

This task uses the existing `students` table created and enhanced in previous tasks.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- MySQL Community Server  
- MySQL Workbench  

(All tools used are free, as per internship guidelines)

---

## 🎯 Task Objectives
The following SQL concepts were practiced and implemented:

- Using aggregate functions such as `COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX`, and `AVG`
- Grouping data using `GROUP BY`
- Filtering grouped results using `HAVING`
- Understanding the difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING`
- Handling `NULL` values in aggregation
- Writing real-world analytical queries

---

## 🔍 Concepts Demonstrated

### Aggregate Functions
Used to perform calculations on multiple rows and return a single summarized value.

### GROUP BY
Groups rows that share common values and allows aggregation on each group.

### HAVING Clause
Used to filter aggregated results after grouping has occurred.

### WHERE vs HAVING
- `WHERE` filters individual rows before grouping
- `HAVING` filters groups after aggregation

---

## 📄 Files Included
- `task5.sql` – Contains SQL queries demonstrating:
  - COUNT, MIN, MAX, AVG functions
  - GROUP BY with and without ORDER BY
  - HAVING clause usage
  - WHERE vs HAVING comparison
  - Real-world analytical examples

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
- Learned how to summarize and analyze large datasets
- Understood how SQL performs grouping and aggregation
- Gained clarity on filtering aggregated data
- Developed skills used in reporting and analytics dashboards
- Improved confidence in writing analytical SQL queries
